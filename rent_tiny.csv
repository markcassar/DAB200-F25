Timeless features such as large factory windows, exposed columns, original brick, and very tall ceilings define this unique residence. This unit receives significant sunlight, and features a large floor plan spacious enough for a living room set up, dining table, and queen or king size bed. <br /><br />OUR THOUGHTS: The property has outdoor parking (for a fee), a large industrial elevator, communal roofdeck, on-site super, and is located just 2 blocks from the Bedford L train, the East River Park, and McCarren Park. This property is simply gorgeous and second to none.  We highly recommend walking through the premises and checking out any available units when they land on the market. <br /><br />*One month free on a 13 month lease.
